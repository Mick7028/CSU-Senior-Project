### Challenges Overcome:

Undertaking the development of a virtual reality game for my senior project was a significant learning experience; one I approach with a sense of reflection and growth. Embarking on this journey without any previous game development experience, I naively chose to create a virtual reality experience, with the vision of seamlessly incorporating language immersion into a realistic city setting. Over the course of 2 ½ years, the journey took unforeseeable turns which included transitioning from Unreal Engine to Unity, acquiring proficiency in C#, and navigating the intricacies of managing a JSON database. Despite facing challenges that extended the project timeline and led to a final product diverging from my initial vision, the valuable insights gained from this ambitious undertaking outweigh the mental anguish I felt all throughout the construction.

I encountered a copious number of technical hurdles, ranging from everyday bugs in the GameManager script to unpredictable crashes in both Unity and QuestLink. Moreover, encounters with unresolvable Unity and Oculus bugs necessitated the development of alternative strategies to circumvent these obstacles. Notably, a persistent issue surfaced during the implementation of high score functionality within the multiple-choice activity. Prompting users to enter their initials upon achieving a new high score posed an unforeseen challenge—Oculus' virtual keyboard failed to appear both in the editor and post-build to the headset. I later discovered that this dilemma, linked to the use of XR Interaction Toolkit instead of Oculus Integration, had persisted over the years, despite community grievances on forums. Unfortunately, the only solution available involved hardcoding a keyboard into the game, an endeavor that could have been mitigated had I opted for Oculus Integration, where a virtual keyboard seamlessly appears upon selecting the input field.

### Future Enhancements:

Many enhancements can be made to this program including voice recognition to help the user practice their pronunciation, more activities and game objects, and improved ways for users to track their progress. With the recent release of the Oculus Quest 3 my plans for this project have shifted to researching the capabilities of augmented reality (AR) instead.

The Quest 3 features color passthrough and has a much wider field of view than the Quest 2. I believe that with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) and object recognition software a person’s entire home could become its own language immersion environment. As technology gets smaller and better, people might wear these devices while doing everyday things like cleaning, cooking, or playing games, and they can pick up a language’s vocabulary without really trying. With the Quest 3 AR, users can also put virtual objects in their space, making it feel more like a home that matches the culture of the language they are learning.

This technology could lead to more sophisticated active learning opportunities, incorporating real-life objects and activities in one's home. AI could dynamically change any text observed in real-time into the target language, facilitating activities such as reading books entirely in a different language, or the headset could replace specific vocabulary and phrases, providing an effective method for gradual language script adaptation while allowing users to enjoy their preferred content.
